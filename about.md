# ModifyLoadingLayer

This is a mod that lets you modify the LoadingLayer's sprites.

### <cy>Keep in mind!</c>

- the textures you replace MUST be the same or around the same size as the original, as it may not work
the preview in the LoadingLayer editor is not always accurate. so make sure to check.

- will have more features soon. 

## before you ask what each button in the editor does
> Erase -> erases your modification
> Reload -> reloads the editor, meaning it'll show your modifications. as i said it is not as accurate.
> restart -> restarts the game
**the rest are self explanatory**


- TODO:
> scale sprite however
> better preview in the editor
> move sprite wherever (planned for later update)
> hide any sprite
> android support (we dont talk about mac)
